/*
 	In this demo, we demonstrate:
	1.	Automatic asset bundle dependency resolving & loading.
		It shows how to use the manifest assetbundle like how to get the dependencies etc.
	2.	Automatic unloading of asset bundles (When an asset bundle or a dependency thereof is no longer needed, the asset bundle is unloaded)
	3.	Editor simulation. A bool defines if we load asset bundles from the project or are actually using asset bundles(doesn't work with assetbundle variants for now.)
		With this, you can player in editor mode without actually building the assetBundles.
	4.	Optional setup where to download all asset bundles
	5.	Build pipeline build postprocessor, integration so that building a player builds the asset bundles and puts them into the player data (Default implmenetation for loading assetbundles from disk on any platform)
	6.	Use WWW.LoadFromCacheOrDownload and feed 128 bit hash to it when downloading via web
		You can get the hash from the manifest assetbundle.
	7.	AssetBundle variants. A prioritized list of variants that should be used if the asset bundle with that variant exists, first variant in the list is the most preferred etc.
